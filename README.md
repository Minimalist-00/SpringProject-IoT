## 📄 Description

This is a web application utilizing sensors created by POLYGON, a student organization I belong to.

We use sensors and Raspberry Pi to collect information such as weather, conference room usage, and the number of times automatic doors open and close. The information collected in this way is displayed as a single web screen.  
In addition, when you put your hands together in front of the screen, a fortune begins to appear😍😍  

## :art: Style changes are described using SASS.
If you want to make changes, please install a Live Server or similar in vscode and have it compile css-like automatically.
